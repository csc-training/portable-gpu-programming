# Kokkos Views

In this exercise you can play with different Kokkos Views. Try to construct different
types of views (different dimensions, memory spaces etc.), and investigate their properties
in different systems (LUMI, Mahti, laptop). The file `views.cpp` contains an example on
how to investigate Views.
