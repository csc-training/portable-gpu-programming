## Error Handling

In this exercise you are given a code with errors. SYCL provides mechanisms to catch both synchonous and asynchronous expections. However the behaiviour dependends a lot on the hardware capabilities, runtime and, drivers. 

The code some errors, invalid launching and out of bounds access. Inspect and run the code, and report the errors found.
