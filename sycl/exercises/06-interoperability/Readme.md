# Using 3rd party libraries. 
Third-party libraries are essential for GPU programming, offering optimized functions and algorithms tailored for specific tasks while abstracting low-level hardware details. This abstraction enables developers to focus on algorithm design and application development, enhancing productivity and efficiency.

For Intel hardware, the [Intel® oneAPI Math Kernel Library](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/onemkl.html) (oneMKL) provides a comprehensive set of low-level routines for math operations. It is highly optimized and extensively parallelized, supporting Intel CPUs and GPUs, with a SYCL interface for integration into SYCL codes.

Nvidia hardware users can leverage the [CUDA toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit), offering a suite of highly optimized libraries such as cuBLAS and cuFFT. These libraries enhance performance for various computational tasks on Nvidia GPUs.

Similarly, for AMD hardware, the [ROCm/HIP](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/HIP/en/latest/) libraries provide optimized routines for GPU-accelerated computing, enabling efficient utilization of AMD GPUs.

At the moment there is no unified interface to select automatically the needed library based on the device with which each queue is associated. Furthermore some libraries such as cu/hipBlas or cu/hipFFT require a gpu stream submit the work in an asynchronous way and integrate the call with previous ans subsenquent kernels. However in general a SYCL queue is not necesseraly associated with given stream. The SYCL standard defines the queue behaviour, but it is up to the `SYCL implementation` how that is mapped to the `cuda/hip stream`. 

## Matrix-Matrix Multiplication 
Consider dense matrix-matrix multiplication. Writing your own code with optimizations can help, but it will never outperform a specialized library.

For more general cases, an optimized library is essential, and its performance depends on the target hardware tied to the queue.

### Intel Hardware with oneMKL and oneAPI
The oneMKL libraries have SYCL interface. They take as argument the SYCL queues and they support both buffers and USM pointers. In some way this is the easiestway. To multiply two matrices just use this:
```
    //# transpose status of matrices for oneMKL
    oneapi::mkl::transpose transA = oneapi::mkl::transpose::nontrans, transB = oneapi::mkl::transpose::nontrans;
    oneapi::mkl::blas::gemm(q, transA, transB, N, N, N, alpha, dev_b, N, dev_a, N, beta, dev_c, N);
```
Where `dev_a` and `dev_b` contain the input data and the results is saved in `dev_c`. These pointers are allocated via USM calls. This call is asynchronous and if the data is needed imediatly the `q.wait()`  call is needed. The SYCL queue which is given as argument needs to be associated with a CPU or an Intel GPU (spir targets). 
In addition to this the proper header needs to be included:
```
#include "oneapi/mkl.hpp"
```

Compiling the code requires some extra flags for linking to the MKL library:
```
-I$MKLROOT/include  -L$MKLROOT/lib/intel64/  -lmkl_sycl -lmkl_core  -lmkl_sequential -lmkl_intel_ilp64
```
Where `MKLROOT` is an environment variable which is set during the initial set up of the oneAPI.
### Nvidia and AMD hardware
In the case non-Intel hardware the specific libraries need to be called. For Nvidia GPUs we use cuBlas, while for AMD hipBlas. Calling directly this library  implies using non-standard functions and  CUDA/HIP features 

### Using AdaptiveCpp
The `AdaptiveCpp_enqueue_custom_operation()` method can be used to create command groups that will execute non-SYCL code. As the name suggests this is only available in the AdaptiveCpp (formerly known as hipsycl) implementation. Below is an example:

```
q.submit([&](handler &cgh) {
     cgh.AdaptiveCpp_enqueue_custom_operation([=](sycl::interop_handle &ih) {
       // Set the correct  stream
       auto cuStream = ih.get_native_queue<sycl::backend::cuda>();
       cublasSetStream(handle, cuStream);
       // Call generalised matrix-matrix multiply
       CHECK_ERROR(cublasSgemm(handle, CUBLAS_OP_N, CUBLAS_OP_N, N,N,
                               N, &alpha, dev_a, N, dev_b, N, &beta,
                               dev_c, N));
     });
   }).wait();
``` 
This method allows to enqueue into the SYCL queue the work done by calling an external library. The `cuda/hip stream` information can be extracted from an `in-order` queue via the `get_native_queue()` method. Using this one can sumbit kernels on a queue, make an asychronous call to cuBlas, and continue the work with the results by submitting more kernels to the same queue. This equivalent to submitting work to the same cuda/hip stream.

### Integrating the different approches into the same code. 
Integrating different approaches into the same codebase can be challenging due to portability concerns. Conditional compilation based on compilation flags can be used to selectively include relevant parts of the code for specific hardware targets. This approach allows maintaining a single codebase while supporting multiple hardware configurations.

We start with the headers:
```
#if MKL_LIB
#include "oneapi/mkl.hpp"  //# oneMKL DPC++ interface
#endif

#if CUBLAS 
// cuda interface
#include <cublas_v2.h>
#include <cuda.h>
```
When compiling for using oneMKL on Intel hardware we add the extra flag `-DMKL_LIB`, this will result in compiling on the line whic includes the oneMKL header. However if the application will be executed on Nvidia GPUs and using cuBlas the option `-DCUBLAS` is needed. Further more into the code a condition compilation can be done to select between `host_task` and `hipSYCL_enqueue_custom_operation`:
```

#if MKL_LIB // uses mkl blas    
        
    //# transpose status of matrices for oneMKL
    oneapi::mkl::transpose transA = oneapi::mkl::transpose::nontrans;
    oneapi::mkl::transpose transB = oneapi::mkl::transpose::nontrans;
  
        
    //# Submit MKL library call to execute on device
    blas::gemm(q, transA, transB, N, N, N, alpha, dev_b, N, dev_a, N, beta, dev_c, N); 

    q.wait(); 
#endif  

#if CUBLAS

// Create cublas handle
  cublasHandle_t handle;
  CHECK_ERROR(cublasCreate(&handle));

#if ACPP
std::cout << "\n"<< "Running with ACPP interoperability. \n";
q.submit([&](handler &cgh) {
     cgh.AdaptiveCpp_enqueue_custom_operation([=](sycl::interop_handle &ih) {
       // Set the correct  stream
       auto cuStream = ih.get_native_queue<sycl::backend::cuda>();
       cublasSetStream(handle, cuStream);
       // Call generalised matrix-matrix multiply
       // Call generalised matrix-matrix multiply
       CHECK_ERROR(cublasSgemm(handle, CUBLAS_OP_N, CUBLAS_OP_N, N,N,
                               N, &alpha, dev_b, N, dev_a, N, &beta,
                               dev_c, N));
     });
   }).wait();
#endif

#if DPCPP  
  std::cout << "\n"<< "Warning!!! " << " \n" << " The DPC++ & CUDA \n relies on the number of assumptions:\n in-order queues,\n no event- or buffer-based dependencies, \n no frequent switching between multiple devices \n stars aligning properly.\n\n"; 
  q.submit([&](handler &h) {
     h.host_task([=](sycl::interop_handle ih) {
       // Set the correct cuda context & stream
       cuCtxSetCurrent(ih.get_native_context<backend::ext_oneapi_cuda>());
       auto cuStream = ih.get_native_queue<backend::ext_oneapi_cuda>();
       cublasSetStream(handle, cuStream);

       // Call generalised matrix-matrix multiply
       CHECK_ERROR(cublasSgemm(handle, CUBLAS_OP_N, CUBLAS_OP_N, N,N,
                               N, &alpha, dev_b, N, dev_a, N, &beta,
                               dev_c, N));
       cuStreamSynchronize(cuStream);
     });
   }).wait();
#endif

#endif
```
This looks ugly and kind of beats the purpose of using SYCL, but if it is only a small part of the whole code it is preferable to having 3-5 different version of the same application written for different devices (CPU, Intel GPU, FPGA, Nvidia GPU, AMD GPU, and so on).

For a complete example implementation, refer to the provided  [code](gemm_mkl_cublas_usm.cpp). Note in the comments at the beginning of the code the instructions for compiling the code for different situations.

## Compilation
Here are the complete compilation options for the various cases.

#### OneAPI with `oneMKL`

```
icpx -std=c++17 -fuse-ld=lld -O3 -fsycl -fsycl-targets=spir64_x86_64 -I$MKLROOT/include  -L$MKLROOT/lib/intel64/  -lmkl_sycl -lmkl_core  -lmkl_sequential -lmkl_intel_ilp64   -DMKL_LIB gemm_mkl_cublas_usm.cpp
``` 

#### AdaptiveCpp with `cuBlas`

```
acpp -fuse-ld=lld -O3 -DCUBLAS -DACPP -I$CUDA_HOME/include/ -L$CUDA_HOME/lib64/ -lcublas -lcudart -lcuda gemm_mkl_cublas_usm.cpp
```

#### AdaptiveCpp with `hipBLas`
The above commands and  were used for Mahti, as an exercise try to make the [code](gemm_mkl_cublas_usm.cpp) run on LUMI. Note that all CUDA calls have HIP equivalents—simply replace the *cu* prefix with *hip*. This will allow the code to run on AMD GPUs without changing the logic.
Fro compilation might use:
```
acpp -fuse-ld=lld -O3 -DHIP -DACPP -I$ROCM_PATH/include/ -L$ROCM_PATH/lib/ -lhipblas -lhipruntime gemm_mkl_cublas_usm.cpp
```
